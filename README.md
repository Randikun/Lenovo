Landing page (LP) Challenge:

Using this mockup as a reference: https://rebrand.ly/lenovodevtest create a landing page with the following requirements:
1)	The LP must be fully responsive. The shared mockup has the desktop view only. For Desktop you have to replicate it as ‚Äúpixel-perfect‚Äù as possible. For mobile and tablet, feel free to adapt it as you consider. Use these breakpoints as a reference:
a.	Mobile: from 320px 
b.	Tablet: from 750px
c.	Desktop: from 1024px
2)	To develop the LP, use CSS and HTML only. Don‚Äôt mount any App or something similar. There is no need to add an extra complexity layer like a component‚Äôs library. CSS and HTML will suffice. Avoid using a CSS library as well. Create your own stylesheets with your own media queries and classes.
3)	For the markup, use HTML5 semantic elements.
4)	Feel free to add any dynamism via JavaScript. It is not necessary but it‚Äôs an extra that will earn you some points. üòä

This are my results!

This is the view for tablets, the main change here is the repositioning of the search bar, and some size adjustments

and this is the one for mobile devices.

In the mobile view I decided to hide the options within a drop-down panel,this is displayed by clicking the 2-line icon . Also those  "product" options, the panel is displayed by clicking the arrow next to Models, in this case, (it would be the option that the user chooses), this to take advantage of the screen to show the product itself, which is the important thing in this LP. The search bar remains on an individual line.
